# NodeJs-ExpressJs-Bootstrap-4
## "Tech company" example website  

routes:  
 /home  (home main page)  
 /team  (like an about page)  
 /services  (fictional services)   
  /feedback  (comment form)  
  /chat   (live chat,doesn't have a saving feature for now)   
 /api (json data file with the feedback form   get,post,delete)  
 

I've focused more on the back-end so it can be a functional website, and on the front-end i used bootstrap 4
for a quick decent looking website,
especially the grid system of Bootstrap and a  mix of vanilla js and jquery for handing the feedback form and the chat page.
