# NodeJs-ExpressJs-Bootstrap-4
My first experience with node,js express,js
npm-packages,creating json files,creating simple api for the feedback form,routes,views,feedback and chat in javascript from scratch.
routes:/home,/team,/services/feedback,/chat,/api



I've learned a lot of things through that project and i love Node's capabilities.
I've focused more on the back-end service and on the front-end i used bootstrap 4
for a quick decent looking website,
especially the grid system of Bootstrap and a little mix of vanilla js and jquery.
